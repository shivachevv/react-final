This project is based on an online fantasy soccer game which I am playing in real life. 
The game is called Fantasy Football Legends (FFL) and this project is an online platform for this game.

React is used for the front end and Firebase for the backend, database and authentication.

Implemented are:
- Login and registration pages, 
- Home page
- Standings page (to be added)
- Team details page (visible for everyone)
- Edit team page (for the team owner only) (to be fixed)
- Admin panel (visible only for users with admin rights)

User can register and pick his initial team. 
The user can change players, team name and logo.

// TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE

- Transfer counts (users to have 1 transfer per week)
- Standings page
- Popup for the players' stats
